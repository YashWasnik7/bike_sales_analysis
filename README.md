1. Bike sales in Europe are 3 times more than America
2. People in Middle age group of 31-55 majorly purchased bikes
3. As the commute distance increase, bike purchases decrease
4. As average salary increases, purchasing power increases, hence bike purchase increased (quite obvious)
5. Marital status and bike purchase are inversely proportional (last bar chart)

In conclusion, the bike companies should target Europeans in Middle age groups for highest sales revenue. 
Furthermore, better sales in Europe could also mean they have better infrastructure for biking and low commute distances.
